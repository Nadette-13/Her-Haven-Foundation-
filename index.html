      <div class="our-story-text">
        <p>My name is <strong>Mfuranzima Nadette</strong>, and I am the proud founder of Her Haven Foundation. I created this foundation because I understand the many challenges young single mothers face every day. From the pressure of raising children alone to battling anxiety, depression, and the uncertainty about the future, these struggles can feel overwhelming and isolating.</p>
        <p>My goal is to build a safe and supportive space where young single mothers can find hope, healing, and the tools they need to rebuild their lives with confidence and strength.</p>
        <p>Her Haven Foundation stands beside these brave women, offering mental wellness support, life skills training, mentorship, and community â€” because every mother deserves a chance at a brighter future.</p>
